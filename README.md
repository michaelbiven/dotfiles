# Common configurations and tools used in how I work. 

Add a few changes after a clean install of Macos 10.13 and a few ideas taken from [Jess](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles) [Frazelle](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles) and [Joe Beda](https://github.com/jbeda/dotfiles).

I also wanted to include the basics of how I like to work.

# Guidelines for Happiness and Success

1. Reduce the level of abstraction in the job/role/task. 
2. Take control of what you need to; either delegate or forget the rest. 
3. People cannot multitask.
4. Make things easier to understand. 
5. Concise and deliberate communication.
6. Document ideas, work, and decisions.
7. Documents should be human readable and machine actionable.
8. Keep healthy, take breaks, and protect yourself.
9. Practice secure habits with how you manage systems, write code, store data, and communicate between them.
10. Keep momentum going on effort, because you can't deliver perfection.
11. Keep learning.
12. Complete a personal project.
